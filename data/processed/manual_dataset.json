While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda.\nThe cushion covers for the Samson Daybed are\nmade to order\n, with an estimated lead time of\napproximately 3 weeks\n. Once your order is placed, a member of our team will be in contact to confirm your fabric selection. You may choose from the fabrics displayed online or explore the\nWarwick fabric range\nfor additional options. Please note that fabric colours may vary slightly from online imagery due to lighting and screen differences.\nClick + Collect\nClick + Collect\nFlat Rate Delivery\nFlat Rate Delivery\nWays to Pay\nWays to Pay\nKey Features - Mango Timber\nThe timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component.\nThis piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations!\nCountry of Origin:\nIndia\nProduct Care - Timber\nHardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below:\nDust regularly with a clean cotton cloth;\nUse tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent  scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately;\nTo nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months.\nOnly use natural wax\n, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer.\nDo not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover\nas these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer\nAvoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents.\nDo not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur.\nAny metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.\nClick + Collect\nClick + Collect\nFlat Rate Delivery\nFlat Rate Delivery\nWays to Pay\nWays to Pay\nSelect Click + Collect at checkout.\nAvailable now in:\nBrisbane (Northgate), QLD\nSelect Click + Collect at checkout.\nAvailable now in:\nBrisbane (Northgate), QLD\nWe have flat rate delivery to most states in Australia.\nEnter your state and postcode at checkout to see your rate.\nIf you can't find an available rate or have a question about the amount quoted please contact us for a custom quote.\nWe have flat rate delivery to most states in Australia.\nEnter your state and postcode at checkout to see your rate.\nIf you can't find an available rate or have a question about the amount quoted please contact us for a custom quote.\nWe offer multiple options to get your new furniture piece sooner including multiple interest free options!\nChoose credit card, Afterpay, Latitude Finance, or Bank Transfer at checkout.\n>\nFind out more\nWe offer multiple options to get your new furniture piece sooner including multiple interest free options!\nChoose credit card, Afterpay, Latitude Finance, or Bank Transfer at checkout.\n>\nFind out more\nMatches perfectly with:\nBonne Daybed\nSale price\n$1,329\nRegular price\n$1,899\nView Details\n+ Add to cart\nComplete the look\nSale\nAlberto Cushion -

Any infringements will be pursued vigorously.\nMaterials & finishes\nBlack American walnut\nBlack walnut is a hardwood with a rich and straight-grained timber, it can display many unique characteristics, such as knots and variations in depth of tone. The walnut we source is native to North America. We use a protective lacquer finish which enables the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage.\nEuropean oak\nEuropean oak is a temperate white oak hardwood native to Europe. It presents a golden to light brown hue with a minimal grain pattern. We use a protective white oil finish to allow the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage.\nDark brown house leather\nOur house leather is a dark brown aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time.\nCare guide\nOiled wood\nAn oiled finish is a durable natural looking finish that can be revitalised (and if necessary, more easily repaired). Oiled finishes require some low level maintenance to keep the wood protected and looking its best.\nDay to day cleaning:\n• Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture.\n• Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible.\n• To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash & Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out.\n6 monthly replenishment / more stubborn stains:\n• As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces\nDo not:\n• Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left)\n• Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain.\nLacquered wood\nA lacquered finish requires very little maintenance and is durable and resistant to spills.\nDay to day cleaning:\n• Wipe clean with a damp cloth then buff off with a clean, dry cloth.\nDo not:\n• Leave any wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible.\n• Use any abrasive cleaning products or bleach as this could damage the protective layer of lacquer.\nHouse leather\nOur house leather is a pure aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely.\nDay to day cleaning:\n• As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner.\nDo not:\n• Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather.\nDiscover more\nDoyle desk\nMenton inlaid leather desk\nLana dressing table II\nLyle console\nRodan console\nEmail us\nCall +44 (0) 207 622 5075\nApply for a trade account\nMake an enquiry\nPlease fill out the form below and one of our sales team will be happy to help.\nChoosing a selection results in a full page refresh.\nOpens in a new window.",

If your mattress is different, we can customize a frame to fit your needs at no added cost.\nTwin  - 42 x 79\nFull  - 58 x 79\nQueen - 66 x 84\nKing  - 82 x 84\nCal King - 78 x 89\nEnso Platform Bed Tear Sheet Download\nWood Selection\nWe source only premium-grade hardwood that exceeds standard furniture industry specifications. While most furniture makers use Number 1 Common grade lumber (typically 66-83% clear wood yield), we hand-select from FAS (First and Seconds) and Select grades that yield 83-100% clear, defect-free wood. This superior grading means wider boards, better color consistency, and exceptional grain matching throughout each piece.\nOur craftsmen spend considerable time matching individual boards for color harmony, character, and grain pattern - a process that results in furniture with visual continuity rarely achieved with standard-grade lumber. These higher grades provide longer, wider clear cuttings that allow us to showcase the wood's natural beauty without interruption from defects.\nWood Species\nWe never stain our wood. Each piece is crafted from 100% natural solid wood in cherry, walnut, white oak, and hard maple - the actual species your furniture will be built from. This approach preserves the wood's authentic grain patterns and natural character while ensuring superior structural integrity.\nOur Signature Finish\nEvery piece receives our proprietary organic finish - a carefully formulated blend of food-grade certified oils and natural waxes developed exclusively for our furniture. This non-toxic, zero-VOC finish penetrates deep into the wood fibers to enhance natural beauty while providing exceptional protection against scratches, moisture, and daily wear.\nKey Benefits:\nEnhanced Beauty\n: Natural oils highlight the wood's grain and develop a rich patina over time that adds character\nSuperior Durability\n: Our oil-based formula creates a protective barrier that's more resilient than many conventional finishes\nEasy Maintenance & Repair\n: Unlike film finishes that chip or peel, our penetrating finish can be easily refreshed and spot-repaired without refinishing the entire piece\nHealth-Conscious\n: Food-grade ingredients make our finish safe around children and those with chemical sensitivities\nThis finishing system represents years of development and testing, resulting in furniture that not only looks beautiful but improves with age and use.\nDining tables\nfeature our commercial-grade finish system, providing restaurant-level durability for water resistance and intensive daily use. Please contact us if you'd like our proprietary organic blend instead.\n★\n★\n★\n★\n★\n5\n\"I searched for 2 years for a bed frame I liked, then I found this one. I ADORE it. It's EXACTLY what I wanted and the craftsmanship is stunning! Tarik is extremely helpful and responsive. I look forward to many years of sweet dreams! Highly recommend!!! The delivery was smooth. The shippers called me the day before delivery and the driver called when he was 30 minutes away. Super experience!\"\nClaudia\n★\n★\n★\n★\n★\n5\n\"Love this bed! It’s beautifully made.

We asked them to build multiple pieces of furniture, most from their designs but also some customization. They were extremely helpful throughout the entire process. Arletta is great with her communication, and when working on customizing, the guys in the shop were great communicating as well. What matters most however, is the final product, which is incredible. We are so happy with our purchase, this furniture is art.\nJonathan Styer\nMar 4, 2022\n★\n★\n★\n★\n★\n5\nAfter looking at many options online, we decided on the One bed frame, and while more expensive than most rivals online, you get what you pay for. This is a handmade, very high quality bed frame with premium hardware and a flawless finish. It takes time for them to make this bed frame, but once it's finished, it's safely packed and shipped quickly. This bed frame will last a lifetime, and it's set back leg will assure that you don't break a toe in the middle of the night. If you are on the fence, buy it! If you think it's too expensive, enjoy your cheap, squeaky bed frame.\nTracy Hancock\nSep 26, 2022\n★\n★\n★\n★\n★\n5\nWe are delighted with the Sunrise Collection Classic Platform bed and Enso Collection dresser, which was artfully customized as a perfect mate for the bed.

Fine Furniture. We had to wait a awhile for our Coffee table but it wasn't a huge deal for us. since we are still in the midst of remodeling. and wait was all worth it. Beautiful dark oak and exquisite workmanship. Now days design of cloth or furniture is very similar from one a other and that makes all the more important when it comes to quality to stand out among sea of temporally furniture's. .\nK Kim\nAug 29, 2023\nPrevious\n1\n/\n2\nNext\nSee more reviews\nYou may also like\nHandcrafted Excellence, Customer Approved\n4.9\n321+ verified reviews\n\"“...The bed frame is solid wood, with the custom finish one would expect from fine furniture.  It is beautiful, aesthetically soothing, and makes me smile every time I see it.  I splurged for the organic mattress (which will outlast me) and am so happy I did.  The comfort is amazing.  The delivery and setup is the best I've ever experienced with any home delivery, and they even removed my old bed and stacked it neatly at the curb.  I'll be visiting them next year for a sofa.  Highly recommend TY Fine Furniture!”\"\n— Sabrena Sally\n\"They truly do an amazing job.

For this reason, his designs celebrate process and craftsmanship, and accentuate components and joinery to create functional pieces with spirit and personality. In recent years, Goodrum’s work has been awarded a host of design accolades including the NGV Rigg Prize, Vogue x Alessi Design Prize, Indesign Luminary Award and the Idea Awards Editor’s Medal. He has also been commissioned to design pieces for several global luxury brands including Veuve Clicquot, Alessi and Cappellini.\nInspiration\nHee Welling x HAY Designer talks.

As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface.\nBecause teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off.\nIf you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection.\nIf you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split.\nTo protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth.\nCollections Using Teak\nAccessories\nArchi\nBay\nBells\nBlock\nBlow\nBora\nCarver\nCoso\nDansk\nDeck\nFern\nGrand Sail\nGrid\nGrid Cabana\nHaven\nKasha\nKay\nLighting\nLima\nMaya\nMetz\nMistral\nNavigator\nOmada\nRail\nRaw\nSalina\nSaranac\nSepal\nSolana\nSplit\nSway\nTrident\nVentura\nWhirl\nWilliam\nWrap\nZenith",

It is equally suited to a relaxed modern Los Angeles home as it is to a New York City apartment.  The steel footrest is an added comfort for resting your heels.  Thoughtful detailing enhances the simple design of this Lostine collection. Each thick leather seat has its own character and variations lending to the appeal of the material. The leather will vary in color and darken with age, like a great bag or a favorite pair of boots. The frame is made of a hard maple wood and sealed to protect the wood but keep the beauty of the wood's natural color. Made in the USA.\nThis item is non-returnable. Excluded from shipping promotions.\nShipping + Returns\nShipping + Returns\nWarranty\nWarranty\nSupport\nSupport\nDimensions\n+ Counter Height: 15 ¼\" W x 17¼\" D x 32\" H x 26 ½\" H (Seat height)\n+ Bar Height: 15¼\" W x 17 ¼\" D x 34\" H x 29 ½\" H (Seat height)\n+ Weight: 18.60 lbs (counter), 18.80 lbs (bar)\nLead Time\n+ Made to order.

This reduces waste (we don’t overproduce inventory or cut into materials that aren’t needed), and keeps our small, hardworking team organized. We have a limited number of people on our team and a made-to-order workflow, so we are only able to produce a certain number of items each week in order to maintain our lead times.\nCan you rush my order?\nWe are unable to rush any made-to-order items, however from time to time we have a small stock of this lamp available on our\nReady to Ship\npage.\nAs an designer or architect, do I qualify for a trade discount?\nWe offer trade services to interior designers, decorators and architects. Members of our Trade Program enjoy an exclusive discount, complimentary samples, tax exemption and more.\nClick here to apply.\nHow do I request a quote for this item?\nPlease submit a quote request via this form, and one of our dedicated account managers will provide your quote within 24-48 hours of your request submission. Quotes are valid for 30 days.\nCan I order a finish sample?\nWe have swatches of our furniture materials available. To order a sample, click\nhere\n.\nWhat is your return policy?\nItems in unused condition may be returned for a full refund after 30 days from when you receive your order, minus the cost of shipping.

Every square inch of the furniture is hand sanded to a smooth finish.\nRead More About Our QUality\nWhy We Shine\nThe sanding between coats is the labor-intensive step that sets our smooth finish apart. Finishers are meticulously trained to leave enough shine to allow for easy maintenance but not so much that it becomes highly reflective and susceptible to finger printing. Our paint finish also knows how to age gracefully. Over the years, it develops a patina of surface scratches that add to the charm of our furniture’s cottage style.\nLearn More About Our Finish\nExtra Guests?\nBeds, bunks, and trundles that keep everyone cottage comfy.\nFresh Squeezed\nWarning: eye-popping paint colors so fun you might not be able to choose just one!\nTime to Talk?\nA conversational chair is the perfect place to park after a long day.\nTeacher's Pet\nWith the right tools, learning is fun!\nClose\nClose",

Avoid using abrasive cleanser that may scratch the plastic. Use a tub/tile/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied. Kannoa products are UV Resistant, and in this case Recyclable.\nSimplicity and Style\nDesigned for durability, practicality and style.\nABOUT OUR MATERIALS\nColorful Plastic\nOur plastic furniture is virtually maintenance-free, all you have to do is bring it home and set it up the way you like it; you won’t have to spend any more time or money on it in the future.

This lets you search through expired domains and filter down by authority, keywords, backlink stuff, even what platform they’re being sold on. And it updates constantly. Feels like a cheat code tbh.\nAnonymous\nPurchased on 24/03/2025\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\nHonestly didn’t expect it to be this good\nSaw this recommended on a forum and didn’t expect much, but wow. The amount of data it shows is crazy for a free tool. I use it mostly to look for brandable names and cross-check SEO value. Already registered a couple. Definitely bookmarking this.\nAnonymous\nPurchased on 01/03/2025\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\nGood for flipping or just grabbing brand names\nBeen using ExpiredDomains for about a month and I’ve already picked up a few solid names — one of them’s already flipped. The name value and SEO price estimates are really handy. I wish the design was a bit cleaner but functionally, it’s spot on.\nAnonymous\nPurchased on 14/03/2025\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\nFree and no login required, love that\nI hate tools that make you sign up before you can even try them. This one just works. I use it to find domains for client projects — it’s quick, gives Moz and Majestic scores, and some other custom data I’ve not seen elsewhere. Would happily pay for it, but glad I don’t have to!\nAnonymous\nPurchased on 19/03/2025\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\nGreat for finding niche domains\nI run a few small affiliate sites and I’m always looking for expired domains with decent backlink profiles. ExpiredDomains saves me a ton of time. Filters are a bit overwhelming at first but once you figure it out, it’s so much faster than doing it manually. Found 3 great ones last week.\nAnonymous\nPurchased on 03/04/2025\nWhy choose Expired Domains?\nHere’s what makes us a better place to start your search.\nComprehensive Listings\nOver 1 million domains across 677+ TLDs — updated daily.\nExclusive Data\nMetrics you won’t find anywhere else, built to highlight true domain value.\nUser-Friendly Interface\nQuick filtering, clean results, and zero guesswork.\nProfessional Trust\nUsed by SEOs, marketers, and investors all over the world!\nWhy GoDaddy\nGoDaddy is one of the most popular domain registries and web hosting providers in the world.

Arrived within 7 business days. 1 box was the wrong color (gray not wheat). Customer service was outstanding and sent the correct box/color same day I notified them.\nInstallation - mounting brackets were easy to attach to the floating tv console and wall. Due to 3 separate pieces being installed, getting them to be flush took a little time. I used a laser level to ensure each wall bracket was lined up evenly. I also made sure the bracket mounted to the consoles were even. I had to put shims behind the bottom section against the wall to ensure the top was even once I attached each console to the wall. Once everything was mounted and even, it looked great. I decided to add extra support screws to ensure when weight was added, the top remained flush. I did this by screwing each Echo section to each other. ( there are lips underneath each section that allow for each section to be screwed together to further strengthen/support. I am extremely happy with how it turned out. I would recommend this product.\nC\nChris B.\n(Newton, Mississippi, United States)\nPerfect for us!\nWe have an 80” tv and found it hard to find something that was big enough for balance. This is a beautiful piece of furniture that came assembled and was easy to put up.\nM\nMarion A.S.\n(Winter Haven, Florida, United States)\nGreat wuality\nM\nMark C.\n(Riverside, California, United States)\nUnique Piece!\nTheir service department was so helpful and worked with us for all our needs! Thank you guys !!\nD\nDavid G.\n(Melbourne, Florida, United States)\nOverall we’re extremely happy with item, the quality and workmanship is excellent. The only problem I had was during assembly. The instructions did not say to install the shelves prior to mounting the unit to the wall. Needless to say I mounted all three units to the wall perfectly level and secure and THEN realized I had to take it all back down to install the shelves 😠\nP\nPatty B.\n(Orlando, Florida, United States)\nExactly as promised!\nEverything was clear and concise upfront and we received exactly what was described right on time.

Disainiprotsessis oleme pühendunud ja põhjalikud. Näiteks Voog tugitoolist valmistasime pea poolsada prototüüpi, kuni jõudsime vormi- ja disainitäiuseni, mis annab edasi meie visiooni – tugitool, mis näeb hea välja, kuid on sealjuures ütlemata mugav.\nDiivanid ja tugitoolid olgu ilusad, kuid sama tähtis on ka mööbli ergonoomika. Iga inimene on erinev ja samuti on erinevad ka inimeste istumisharjumused ja ootused mugavusele. Mõnele sobib jäik ja hästi selga toetav diivan, teisele jälle võimalikult pehme sohva. Seda kõike arvestame tootearendusprotsessis, et jõuda parima tasakaaluni esteetika ja funktsionaalsuse vahel.\nLoe meist rohkem\nOOT-OOT STUUDIO TALLINN\nT – R 11:00 – 18:00\nL 11:00 – 15:00\nNB!

The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring.\n​\nWhere castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard.\nWhere legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see 'Leg Options' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard.\nAll of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate.\nThe price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know.\nFabric quantities for standard models in plain fabric are shown in the product description.\nF\nor patterns, and bespoke sizes, get in touch and we can advise on fabric quantity.\nCamden Armchair\nEbury Armchair\nHanover Armchair\nElmstead Loveseat",

(production or lead time)\nAt Oak For Less® furniture, we offer furniture from many different builders.  Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana.  Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others.  We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made.\nSince lead times can vary, we give an estimated range.  These lead times are\nAPPROXIMATE\n, they are\nNOT EXACT\n.  Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders and/or shippers.  These situations are beyond our control.  By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is our\nbest estimate\n.  When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it.\nCurrent estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix\n.\nFor example, item OD-O-T462-Q has an \"OD-\" at the beginning of its item #.  On our list below, OD- items have a lead time of 6 - 8 weeks.  So item OD-O-T462-Q has a lead time of 6 - 8 weeks\n**\n.  Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it.\n**\nIf your delivery location is\noutside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra\nto these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements.  Also, i\nf the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.\nPrefix:\nApproximate lead time:\nES\n* Call for current production time *\nFA / FUS\n* Call for current production time *\nHM\ncontact us for stock availability\nIFD\ncontact us for stock availability\nOD\n6 - 8 weeks\nSA\n12 - 16 weeks\nSD\ncontact us for stock availability\nTM\n8 - 12 weeks\nIf you don't see the prefix of your item # here, please call us at\n480-962-9930\nto ask about the current production time.\nNeed to expedite your order?\nWe're here to help.

Delivery is available if the customer is located within designated delivery areas. Delivery contractors do their best to be careful when delivering furniture, but in the event damage occurs to walls, flooring, etc., the customer will take up any issues solely with the independent contractor.\nCustomers must have the room ready for the delivery when it is scheduled.\nDelivery does NOT include moving old furniture or electronic devices such as TVs or audio/video components. If you ask them to do extra work, they will charge extra.\nWith any delivery method, the customer is responsible for making sure that the items will fit through their hallways and into the room of choice. If the driver cannot easily deliver it to the room of choice (narrow hallways/tight turns/low ceilings/is asked to move other furniture) there will be additional cost that must be paid to the delivery service at the time of the delivery. Regardless if the furniture fits into the room of choice or does not, the customer is still responsible for paying the delivery fee, it is not refundable.\nIf the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.\nBlanket Wrap delivery (states outside of Arizona)\n:\nBlanket Wrap delivery starts at $395. and goes up depending on the item(s) and delivery area.  To be sure of the delivery cost for your area, please contact our store and ask for a precise delivery quote.  Different blanket wrap delivery services serve different areas, so this delivery includes bringing the item(s) inside and either putting them in the first dry area (threshold delivery) or depending on the shipper for your area into the room of choice (1st floor only) - it depends on the service for your area.\nIf your delivery requires stairs or steps or an elevator, we need to know in advance at the time of order because some shippers will not do stairs\n. Stairs or elevators may require an additional charge, it all depends upon which shipper it is.\nIf you order a\nplatform\nbed, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, and also includes up to 30 minutes of assembling the platform bed.\nIf you order a table, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, but it does not include assembly of the table.  If you require table assembly, please contact us at the time of order because some shippers will not do assembly.\nThis may require an additional charge, depending on the shipper.\nPlease note that Blanket Wrap\ndelivery does NOT include\nattaching or reversing hardware or\ninstalling and arranging adjustable shelves inside of a bookcase or cabinet as this can be time consuming\n.\nIt also does NOT include attaching a headboard to a customer's existing bedframe as the hole locations that need to be drilled into the headboard can vary depending on the existing bedframe\n.\nBlanket Wrap delivery outside of Arizona is a one or two person delivery.\nAn adult must be at the residence to sign for and accept the item(s) in good condition.\nBasic delivery (within Arizona only)\n:\nBasic delivery covers areas within Arizona only.  Basic delivery within Arizona\nstarts\nat $149.\nand goes up depending on the item(s), if set up is needed, and the delivery area\n.  Basic delivery includes the following: Placement inside the home - first floor, no stairs.

Moo may be used for both indoor and outdoor decoration. The figuratively shaped lamp body is made of poly–resin material, that gives a smooth and transparent flow of light. The bulbs placed inside the horns add extra elements of soft, sparkling and translucent light effects to the lamp.\nThe inspiration behind the Moo lamp was found in northern Norway, –in the breathtaking scenery of Hamarøy, where both designers have summer houses. Here the moose is frequently seen passing close to the houses and even on the lawns. The designers hope Moo will stand out as a post–modern kitch trophy, making the viewer smile happily as they recognize this “King of the Norwegian forest”.\nWall lamp\nShade material: Polyresin and glass fibre\nShade colour: White\nBase material: Steel\nWire: White, 190 cm\nBulbs main body: 2 x E27 energy saving bulb.
